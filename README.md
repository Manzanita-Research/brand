# Manzanita Research

**Futuristic tools for musicians and producers.**

Manzanita Research is an AI lab building instruments, interfaces, and creative tools for the people who make music. We exist at the intersection of deep technical research and artistic intuition — a place where signal processing papers meet studio sessions, where neural networks serve the song.

Think Xerox PARC, but for music technology. A small, independent research lab inventing the future of how music gets made.

## Why "Manzanita"

The manzanita is a California native — a scrubby, twisting tree that grows wild on coastal hillsides where nothing else will. It doesn't need much. It thrives in hard soil, in drought, in the rocky margins between the forest and the sea. But it produces something unmistakable: dark red bark, smooth as skin, and branches so sculptural that people seek them out for handcrafted furniture and art.

Every manzanita branch is different. No two grow the same way.

That's the energy. A small lab that grows where the big institutions don't. Bespoke tools, not mass-market software. Research shaped by the needs of real musicians, not quarterly roadmaps.

## Tone of Voice

Manzanita speaks like a musician who happens to be an engineer — or an engineer who never stopped playing in bands. The tone is:

- **Warm and grounded**, never corporate. We talk like people, not product pages.
- **Technically confident**, but never gatekeeping. We explain hard things simply because we actually understand them.
- **Poetic when it matters.** We're not afraid of beauty in our language, but we don't force it. The lyricism comes from caring deeply, not from trying to sound smart.
- **Unhurried.** We don't hype. We don't do countdowns or "exciting announcements." We share work when it's ready and let it speak.
- **Direct.** Short sentences. Clear positions. We say what we mean.

We never say: "leverage," "ecosystem," "disrupt," "revolutionize," "game-changing," "cutting-edge," "unlock," "empower," "seamless," "next-gen."

We might say: "We built this because we needed it." / "Here's what we're working on." / "This isn't finished yet, but it's interesting."

## Values

**By the homies, for the homies.**

Manzanita exists to serve the people who actually make music — not to extract value from them. Everything we build starts from a place of deep reverence for the IRL music community: the local scenes, the independent venues, the bedroom producers, the weirdos with four-tracks, the people keeping live music alive in California and along the West Coast.

This is post-capitalist work. We don't build tools to capture markets. We build tools to give away power.

**What that means in practice:**

- **Local-first, offline-first.** Your tools should work on your machine, without an internet connection, without a subscription server deciding whether you're allowed to make music today. Fast, private, yours.
- **No surveillance capitalism.** We don't collect data on how you create. We don't train on your sessions. We don't monetize your workflow. The relationship between a musician and their instrument is sacred and we build software that respects that.
- **Open where it matters.** Research should be shared. Tools should be repairable. Knowledge should flow freely. We publish our work, we document our thinking, and we build things that people can learn from, fork, and make their own.
- **Technology in service of community.** The question is never "what can AI do?" It's "what do musicians need?" and then "can we build that well?" If the answer to the second question is no, we wait until we can. We don't ship demos dressed up as products.
- **Uplift, don't replace.** We build instruments, not automations. Tools that make human musicians more expressive, more capable, more free — never tools that make human musicians less necessary.

## Lineage

Before the cultural references, the intellectual lineage. Manzanita draws from a thread of California thinking that's been largely abandoned by the current tech landscape:

**Stewart Brand and the Whole Earth Catalog.** "Access to tools" — the idea that technology should be published, democratized, and put directly into the hands of people doing real work. The Catalog wasn't a store. It was a community resource guide. That's the energy.

**Buckminster Fuller.** Doing more with less. Designing for the whole system. Asking "how does this serve everyone?" before asking "how does this scale?"

**The back-to-the-land movement.** The conviction that you could build a better life with your hands, outside the institutions, if you had the right knowledge and the right tools. That self-sufficiency and community aren't opposites — they're the same thing.

**Early cyberculture, before it curdled.** John Perry Barlow writing about freedom and responsibility in the same breath. The WELL as a genuine community, not a platform. The moment when networked computing felt like it might actually connect people instead of surveilling them.

**Druid Heights, Esalen-before-the-techies, Big Sur in the off-season.** Places where people went to think clearly, live simply, and do serious work without the noise. Not retreats for optimization — sanctuaries for genuine inquiry.

These aren't nostalgic references. They're unfinished projects. The counterculture asked real questions about technology, autonomy, and community that the current AI landscape has completely abandoned in its rush to ship and scale. Manzanita picks those questions back up.

## Cultural References

The world Manzanita lives in. Not a mood board — a sense memory.

**Sound:** Laurel Canyon in 1971. Joni Mitchell tuning a dulcimer. Fleetwood Mac's _Tusk_ sessions — ambitious, expensive, a little unhinged. The warmth of analog tape saturating on the way in. Pedal steel guitar through a spring reverb. A rehearsal in someone's living room that turns into the best take.

**Place:** California's central coast. Fog burning off by noon. Highway 1 with the windows down and no cell service. Redwood groves where the light comes through golden-green. Wildflower season in the coastal ranges — lupine, poppies, sage. The smell of eucalyptus after rain.

**Feeling:** Sunday morning, no plans. A workbench covered in half-finished projects that you're genuinely excited about. The moment a new tool clicks and you forget you're using it. Late afternoon sun on bare wood floors. The particular satisfaction of something handmade that works perfectly.

**Style:** Embroidered bell bottoms and tie-front blouses. Bolo ties. Worn leather and brass hardware. Mustangs and VW buses. Stevie Nicks in platform boots. Faded concert tees from shows that actually happened. Nothing precious, everything lived-in.

**Spirit:** Independent, feminine, Californian. More canyon than campus. More workshop than office. A lab in the sense that things get made here — not in the sense that anyone wears a lab coat.

## Visual Direction

_To be extended into a full design system._

The palette lives in the warm, muted, sun-faded range — terracotta, sage, ochre, cream, rust, dried lavender. Accents in deep redwood brown (the color of manzanita bark). Nothing neon, nothing pure black-on-white.

Typography should feel human. Something with a little weight and character — not a geometric sans-serif from a startup template.

Photography and illustration should feel candid, natural-light, slightly grainy. Film stock over digital. Golden hour over studio lighting. Instruments in rooms, not on pedestals.

## Project Naming

Individual projects and tools are named after California native plants and chaparral species, keeping everything in the same poetic ecosystem:

- Toyon
- Ceanothus
- Yerba Buena
- Lupine
- Buckeye
- Madrone
- Sage

These are working references — not every project needs a plant name, but the option is there when it fits.
