This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

This is the brand identity and guidelines repository for **Manzanita Research** — an independent AI lab building tools for musicians and producers. There is no build system, no tests, no application code. The repo contains brand documentation and design skills.

## Brand Voice (Critical for Any Content Work)

Manzanita speaks like a musician who happens to be an engineer. When writing copy, docs, or any text for this brand:

- Warm, grounded, direct. Short sentences. Never corporate.
- Technically confident but never gatekeeping. Explain hard things simply.
- Poetic when it matters, but never forced.
- Unhurried. No hype, no countdowns, no "exciting announcements."
- **Never use:** "leverage," "ecosystem," "disrupt," "revolutionize," "game-changing," "cutting-edge," "unlock," "empower," "seamless," "next-gen."
- **Instead say things like:** "We built this because we needed it." / "Here's what we're working on."

## Core Values

- Local-first, offline-first. Tools work on your machine without subscriptions.
- No surveillance capitalism. No data collection on creative work.
- Open where it matters. Research shared, tools repairable.
- Instruments, not automations. Uplift musicians, never replace them.
- Post-capitalist ethos: build to give away power, not capture markets.

## Visual Direction

- Palette: warm, muted, sun-faded — terracotta, sage, ochre, cream, rust, dried lavender. Accents in deep redwood brown (manzanita bark).
- Nothing neon, nothing pure black-on-white.
- Typography should feel human, with weight and character. No geometric sans-serifs from startup templates.
- Photography feel: candid, natural-light, slightly grainy. Film stock over digital.

## Project Naming Convention

Individual projects are named after California native plants: Toyon, Ceanothus, Yerba Buena, Lupine, Buckeye, Madrone, Sage.

## Repo Structure
