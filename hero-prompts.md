# Hero Image Prompts

Prompts for generating hero images across Manzanita Research projects. Designed for Recraft V4 / V4 Pro via Flora.

## Prompting Notes

- **Model**: Recraft V4 for still lifes and landscapes. V4 Pro for scenes with people or complex compositions.
- **Aspect**: 16:9 for hero images, 1:1 for social/profile use.
- **Don't add** "photorealistic" or "8K" — Recraft already leans editorial.

## Style Suffix

Append to any prompt for consistency:

> eco-futurist, feminine, 1980s-meets-2180s California. Kodak Eastman 100T 5247 35mm film, grain, halation, faded warm colors, natural lens flares, shallow depth of field

## Rules

- **No pastiches of real hardware.** No 1073s, no LA2As, no SSL consoles, no recognizable vintage gear. We're inventing interfaces. Any depicted hardware should feel unfamiliar — new instruments, not nostalgia.
- **Feminine energy.** Not girly, not soft-focus romance. Feminine like Stevie Nicks is feminine — powerful, intuitive, a little wild. Women as inventors, builders, players.
- **Futuristic + natural.** Bleeding-edge technology in canyon light. Redwood forests and custom circuitry. The future grows here.

## Manzanita Research (org-level)

### The Lab in the Canyon
> A woman's hands assembling an unfamiliar electronic instrument on a sunlit wooden workbench, components that don't quite exist yet, manzanita branches visible through an open window overlooking coastal California hills, golden afternoon light, eco-futurist, feminine, Kodak Eastman 100T 5247 35mm film, grain, halation, faded warm colors

### The Canyon
> Manzanita trees on a California coastal hillside at magic hour, red bark glowing in low sun, fog below in the valley, a single thin antenna or sensor barely visible among the branches — technology woven into the landscape, slightly overexposed highlights, warm ochre and sage, 35mm film grain, halation

### The Session
> A woman playing electric guitar in a small studio filled with plants and warm light, unfamiliar audio interfaces with softly glowing displays on the desk beside her, late afternoon sun through the window, candid and absorbed, Kodak Eastman 100T 5247, natural lens flare, grain, faded warm tones

## Toneword (semantic EQ)

### Shaping Tone
> Close-up of a woman's hand adjusting an interface that doesn't exist — a smooth, sculptural knob on a device with a warm OLED display showing the word "velvet," wooden housing, terracotta and cream palette, shallow depth of field, tungsten light, Kodak Eastman 100T 5247 35mm, grain, halation

### The Pedal
> A single beautiful effects pedal on a redwood floor, design language that feels invented — rounded edges, a small amber display, no recognizable brand, afternoon sunlight casting a long warm shadow, shot from above at a slight angle, eco-futurist, 35mm film aesthetic, faded warm colors

### Listening
> A woman with closed eyes and headphones in a sun-drenched room, light catching dust in the air, expression of deep focus and pleasure, plants on the windowsill, the feeling of hearing something perfectly shaped, Kodak Eastman 100T 5247 35mm, grain, halation, natural lens flare, feminine

## AudioTree (audio component library)

### The Signal Path
> An unfamiliar modular instrument with patch cables in warm earth tones — terracotta, sage, rust, cream — panels made of wood and brushed copper, softly glowing connection points, no recognizable hardware, eco-futurist design, soft studio lighting, shallow focus, Kodak Eastman 100T 5247, grain, halation

### Branching
> A manzanita branch splitting into smaller branches, backlit by golden hour sun against a cream sky, overlaid with faint translucent lines suggesting a signal flow diagram — nature as architecture, minimal and striking, 35mm film grain, halation, warm faded tones

---

## Understory (Claude Code skills)

### The Forest Floor
> Redwood forest understory, soft diffused light through the canopy, ferns and sorrel glowing green, a barely-visible thread of light running along the forest floor like a data stream, morning mist, eco-futurist, quiet and contemplative, Kodak Eastman 100T 5247 35mm, grain, halation

### The Transfer
> A woman at a wooden desk transferring hand-drawn sketches onto a glowing screen that feels organic — rounded edges, warm amber display — notebooks open beside her, California light through the window, the moment between idea and implementation, 35mm film grain, faded warm colors, feminine

---

## Chaparral (org skill sharing)

### Root System
> Underground root network of chaparral plants in cross-section, roots glowing faintly with bioluminescent light where they connect, dry California soil above, warm earth tones, the hidden infrastructure that connects everything, macro botanical photography meets eco-futurism, Kodak Eastman 100T 5247, grain

### The Network
> A hillside of California native plants — manzanita, ceanothus, sage — connected by thin luminous threads barely visible in the golden hour light, the chaparral as a living network, wide shot, atmospheric, Kodak Eastman 100T 5247 35mm, halation, faded warm colors, natural lens flares
