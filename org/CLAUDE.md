# Manzanita Research — Org-Wide Instructions

This file is shared across all Manzanita Research projects via [chaparral](https://github.com/manzanita-research/chaparral). It lives in the brand repo and gets symlinked to the org parent directory so every sibling project inherits it.

## Brand Voice

Manzanita speaks like a musician who happens to be an engineer. When writing copy, docs, UI text, error messages, or any text for this org:

- Warm, grounded, direct. Short sentences. Never corporate.
- Technically confident but never gatekeeping. Explain hard things simply.
- Poetic when it matters, but never forced.
- Unhurried. No hype, no countdowns, no "exciting announcements."
- **Never use:** "leverage," "ecosystem," "disrupt," "revolutionize," "game-changing," "cutting-edge," "unlock," "empower," "seamless," "next-gen."
- **Instead say things like:** "We built this because we needed it." / "Here's what we're working on."

## Core Values

- Local-first, offline-first. Tools work on your machine without subscriptions.
- No surveillance capitalism. No data collection on creative work.
- Open where it matters. Research shared, tools repairable.
- Instruments, not automations. Uplift musicians, never replace them.
- Post-capitalist ethos: build to give away power, not capture markets.

## Project Naming

Individual projects are named after California native plants: Toyon, Ceanothus, Yerba Buena, Lupine, Buckeye, Madrone, Sage.

## Technical Defaults

- Prefer Bun over Node when starting new JS/TS projects.
- Prefer Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Prefer React for UI work.
- Write tests for anything non-trivial.
- Commit messages should be lowercase, concise, and describe the why.
